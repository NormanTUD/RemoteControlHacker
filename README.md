# RemoteControlHacker

This script tries to hack a remote-control with knowledge of several protocols that can easily be
expanded.

It only generates valid commands and thus skips hundreds of thousands of invalid codes.

The code can be run with an Arduino and an Infrared-LED until it succeeds (needs manual supervision for
testing success).

When editing the Arduino-Code and sending the Signals over Serial-Port, it can be made much more efficient,
but I was too lazy to do that since I abandoned the original project's purpose, but I still want to make
it public, in the case anybody may find it useful.

It it licensed under the WTFPL.
